# rustmplotlib (WIP)

Bindings to matplotlib using pyo3

Using [rustplotlib](https://github.com/ubnt-intrepid/rustplotlib) as the main reference with goal of changing syntax for actual plotting.
[matplotlib-rs](https://github.com/mneumann/matplotlib-rs) is another source off which this lib is built.

Currently using python 3.8, matpotlib 3.2.2 installed for path.
